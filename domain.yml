  utter_ttf_services:
  - text: The Trip The Fan crew can do merch stock photography, graphic design, website
      design, snapchat filters, and ads across most platforms!
  utter_ttf_roster:
  - text: Right now trip The Fan doesn't have anyone officially signed on their roster,
      but they are helping random artists they like across Oklahoma.
  utter_ttf_levi:
  - text: Levi is Trip the Fan's founder. He's a ramen and Wes Anderson enthusiast
      who spends countless hours staring at his phone and computer screens. When he's
      not working on projects for the artists on his roster (a.k.a. getting sushi
      and talking about merchandise), you can find him making a cup, or three, of
      tea (probably oolong). Levi enjoys taking artsy photos, but cannot stand to
      have his photo taken. On occasion he thinks he can play violin and piano (we
      don't want to hurt his feelings and tell him he's not good).
  utter_ttf_trin:
  - text: Trinity is a partner at Trip the Fan. She loves going on walks and climbing,
      but the real kind, out in the woods and stuff. To prepare for all that activity,
      she loves to eat a ton of pasta (preferably chicken alfredo). Just kidding,
      she probably eats all that pasta while she’s watching her fantasy shows (ya
      know, dragons and whatnot). Trinity is also the social media and branding consultant
      and content creator queen, maker of the pretty things. She’s an avid consumer
      of the pretty things as well, often found sitting down to drink a London fog
      while looking at art and reading poetry. How hipster of her.
  utter_ttf_sam:
  - text: Photographies his game, Sam’s his name, he currently is managing one band
      and is looking to make big moves in the future. Sam is the movie fanatic of
      Trip the Fan, his love of classic film making and all things old has fueled
      his passion for the arts. (such as music and stuff.) Born in Colorado and stripped
      from the mountains at the ripe age of one, he is seeking safe passage back to
      his mountainous home. He enjoys casual conversations about the many conspiracy
      theories that populate the internet and despises talking about the weather.
      Most nights you can find Sam Chillin like a villain watching his Candian hick
      shows.
  utter_ttf_julie:
  - text: Julie is an artist manager at Trip the Fan. Born and raised in Dallas, Texas.
      She loves any and anything Dallas related. In her free time (or what little
      free time she does have), you can find Julie watching the Dallas Mavericks,
      Dallas Cowboys, or the Oklahoma Sooners. She cannot start her day without a
      Dr. Pepper (we get it, you’re from Texas) in hand. She has a heart for building
      relationships with artists before tackling the business side. She loves people
      (odd right?). Julie has an associates in music business and is working towards
      her bachelors degree in commercial music from the University of Central Oklahoma.
