Born in Colorado and stripped from the mountains at the ripe age of one, he is seeking safe passage back to his mountainous home. He enjoys casual conversations about the many conspiracy theories that populate the internet and despises talking about the weather. Most nights you can find Sam chillin like a villain watching his Candian hick shows."
